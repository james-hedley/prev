Title: Make changes to a variable row by row
Version: 0.1.0

Description: Make changes to a variable based on its previous or susbequent values, iteratively.




By default, R treats a variable within a dataset as a vector. If you use something like dplyr::lag() the entire vector will be lagged at the same time.




However, sometimes you may want to apply changes to a variable row by row. prev::prev() makes changes to a variable row by row, which produces similar results to other statistical software packages (e.g. Stata or SAS).
